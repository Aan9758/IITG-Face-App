✅ This version:  
- Puts **Live Demo button right at the top**.  
- Has a **short, neat structure** (Features → Tech → Install → Use → Contact).  
- Clean look without extra badges, tables, or placeholders.  

Would you like me to also make a **screenshot preview banner** (like a mock app screenshot at the top under the button) so it looks visually catchy when someone opens the repo?
